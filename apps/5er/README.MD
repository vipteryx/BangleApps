# 5er - For the BangleJS

A fork of [Chimer](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/chimer) that adds 5 minute intervals.

Setting the hours you don't want your watch to chime for is done by setting the hour you want it to stop, and the hour you want it to start.

Hours range from 0 - 23.
